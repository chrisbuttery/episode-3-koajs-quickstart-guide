In the last [Episode](http://knowthen.com/episode-2-understanding-javascript-generators/ "Episode") I talked about JavaScript generators, and how they can make your developer life a little more pleasant.  This week I am giving you a quickstart tutorial on using [Koajs](http://koajs.com/ "Koajs") the first web framework built from the ground up using generators.

Koajs was built by [the](https://github.com/tj) [developers](https://github.com/jonathanong) that created [express.js](https://github.com/strongloop/express "Express"), so they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to koajs.

I believe we are at the beginning of a huge adoption of koajs in the node community, so if you are just learning node.js, starting a new side project or beginning a greenfield project at work you should seriously consider koajs. It provides a totally refreshing approach to building web applications in node.js.

In this episode I will show you how to install nodejs and create a basic Koajs app as well as create custom middleware.

To run this demo, enter:

```bash
$ npm install
```
